# üîñ Todo With Flutter

A simple todo app built with Appwrite and Flutter

If you simply want to try out the App, go ahead and check out the demo at https://appwrite-todo-with-flutter.vercel.app


## üé¨ Getting Started

### ü§ò Install Appwrite
Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice.

> Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend can access it.

We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server.

1. Add a new Web App in Appwrite and enter the endpoint of your website (`localhost, <project-name>.vercel.app etc`)

2. Create a new collection with the following properties
* **Rules**

Add the following rules to the collection.
> Make sure that your key exactly matches the key in the images

* FLUTTER_APP_PROJECT - Your Appwrite project ID
* FLUTTER_APP_COLLECTION_ID - Your Appwrite collection ID
