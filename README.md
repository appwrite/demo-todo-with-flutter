# üîñ Todo With Flutter 

A simple todo app built with Flutter and Appwrite

## üé¨ Getting Started

Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

## ü§ò Install Appwrite

Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice.

    Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend 
    can access it.

We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server.

### Add a new Flutter App in Appwrite and enter application id of your application (io.appwrite.todo, etc)

### Create a new database

### Within your new database create a new collection with the following properties

Add the following attributes to the collection.

Make sure that your key exactly matches the key in the images

Add the following permissions to your collections. These permissions ensure that only registered users can access the collection.

Make sure to update the bucket permissions to allow create and file level security.

## üöÄ Deploy the Front End

You have two options to deploy the front-end and we will cover both of them here. In either case, you will need to fill in these environment variables that help your frontend connect to Appwrite.

    FLUTTER_APP_ENDPOINT - Your Appwrite endpoint
    FLUTTER_APP_PROJECT - Your Appwrite project ID
    FLUTTER_APP_DATABASE_ID = Your Appwrite database ID
    FLUTTER_APP_COLLECTION_ID - Your Appwrite collection ID
    FLUTTER_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID - Your Appwrite Storage Bucket ID
  
## Run locally

Follow these instructions to run the demo app locally

`git clone https://github.com/appwrite/demo-todo-with-flutter.git`

`cd demo-todo-with-flutter`

Make a one file in the Clone Repo called `lib/res/constant.dart

```dart
class AppConstant {
    static const String endPoint = 'your own endpoint';
    static const String projectid = 'your appwrite project id';
    static const String database = 'your appwrite database id';
    static const String collection = 'your appwrite collection id';
    static const String bucket = 'your appwrite storage bucket id';
}
```

Now run the following commands and you should be good to go üí™üèº

`flutter pub get`
`flutter run`

## Features

1. User can Login and Signup the app.
2. User can add, update the profile picture.
