# üîñ Todo With Flutter

A simple todo app built with Flutter and Appwrite

## üé¨ Getting Started

Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

### ü§ò Create Appwrite Project
The easiest way to get started with Appwrite is by [signing up for Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) and creating a new project.

> If you want to try self-hosting Appwrite, follow our simple [Self-Hosting Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice. 
  
We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite project. 

1. Add a new Flutter App (Android or iOS or both) in Appwrite:

   ![Console - Add platform](docs/Console%20-%20Add%20platform.png)

   1. Android - `io.appwrite.demo_todo_with_flutter`
   2. iOS/Mac OS - `io.appwrite.demoTodoWithFlutter`

2. Create a project in the Appwrite Console with id `demo-todos`.

3. Use the [Appwrite CLI](https://appwrite.io/docs/command-line) to deploy the required collections.

   ```shell
   appwrite deploy collections
   ```

### üöÄ Run locally

Follow these instructions to run the demo app locally.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/appwrite/demo-todo-with-flutter.git
cd demo-todo-with-flutter
```

Make `lib/constant.dart` using `lib/constants.dart.example` as a template.

Now run the following commands and you should be good to go üí™üèº

```shell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
