# üîñ Todo With Flutter 

A simple todo app built with Flutter and Appwrite

## üé¨ Getting Started

Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

### ü§ò Install Appwrite

Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice.

    Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend 
    can access it.

We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server.

1. Add a new Flutter App (Android or iOS or both) in Appwrite and enter application id of your application (io.appwrite.todo, etc)

2. Create a new collection with the following properties

 - Permissions

Add the following permissions to your collections. These permissions ensure that only registered users can access the collection.

## üöÄ Deploy the Front End

You have two options to deploy the front-end and we will cover both of them here. In either case, you will need to fill in these environment variables that help your frontend connect to Appwrite.

    FLUTTER_APP_ENDPOINT - Your Appwrite endpoint
    FLUTTER_APP_PROJECT - Your Appwrite project ID
    FLUTTER_APP_COLLECTION_ID - Your Appwrite collection ID
  
## Run locally

Follow these instructions to run the demo app locally

$ git clone https://github.com/appwrite/demo-todo-with-flutter.git
$ cd todo-with-flutter

Make a one file in constant.dart

```dart
class AppConstant {
    static const String projectid = 'your appwrite project id';
    static const String endPoint = 'your own endpoint';
    static const String database = 'your appwrite database id';
}
```

Now run the following commands and you should be good to go üí™üèº

$ flutter pub get
$ flutter run


## Features
